      <p>
        I've also used other languages, databases and frameworks
      </p>
      <p>
        Most notably <a href="https://github.com/BijesniPatuljak/Java-ray-tracer">Java</a>, but I'd like to keep away from it
      </p>
      <p>
        You might also be able to find some PHP I've written, which just might be my most disliked language
      </p>

      <p>
        My other experiences would include basic knowledge of Heroku and AWS in a professional environment
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-structured databases and docker (while I was a student)
      </p>
      <p>
        And some knowledge and experience in other tools like:
      </p>
      <p>
        Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma and Excel
      </p>
    </div>
