        C and C++ were my go-to languages;
      </p>
      <p className='tab1'>
        Not by personal preference but by the faculty's curriculum;
      </p>
      <p className='tab1'>
        Nevertheless, I enjoy working with them;
      </p>
      <p className='tab1'>
        I learnt data structures, algorithms, memory and time menagement with them;
      </p>
      <p className='tab1'>
        And created some smaller games like tetris and snake using SFML;
      </p>
      <p className='tab1'>
        I grew to love both languages && expand to C#;
      </p>
      <p className='tab1'>
        With a tv_manager being the most notable (student) project;
      </p>
      <p className='tab1'>
        I'd love to continue working in the C family, especially C#;
      </p>
      <p className='tab1'>
        I belive that static types are the way to go in bigger projects;
