          The first opportunity I got was in Ruby on Rails

          At first I leaned on my experiences in Python
        </p>
        <p className='tab1'>
          But I got the hang of it really quickly

          when (the first big project came)
        </p>
        <p className='tab1'>
          Ruby on Rails was what I used

          To continuously work on an LMS for almost two years

          I'm no stranger to Devise, Sidekiq, GoodJob, Anycable || RSpec
