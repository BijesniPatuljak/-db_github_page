          The first opportunity I got was in Ruby on Rails
        </p>

          At first I leaned on my experiences in Python
        </p>
        <p className="tab1">
          But I got the hang of it really quickly

          Ruby on Rails was what I used

        <p className="tab1">
          To continuously work on an LMS for almost two years
        </p>
        <p className="tab1">
          Which wasn't only an LMS but also party an administration service

          && (Everything it wasn't able to manage)
        </p>
        <p className="tab1">
          From the basics like: models || controllers || serializers || services
        </p>
        <p className="tab1">
          As well as database_views || delegates || Arel
        </p>
        <p>
          when (it comes to jobs and gems)
        </p>
        <p className="tab1">
          I'm no stranger to Redis, Devise, Sidekiq, GoodJob, Anycable || RSpec
        </p>
        <p className="tab1">
          && many more, which is why I would default to Ruby on Rails
        </p>
        <p className="tab1">
          If there's an opportunity for a, especially smaller, project
        </p>
        <p className="tab1">
          Like the one's you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/BijesniPatuljak?tab=repositories">GitHub</a>

          I'd prefer using a strongly typed language, which is also why
        </p>
        <p className="tab1">
          The Sorbet gem peaks my interest
        </p>
        <p className="tab1">
          Because it provides the much needed type safety for some bigger projects
